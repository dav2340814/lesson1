The IDE (or text editor) I chose for this class is Neovim.
Just as Vim built on vi, Neovim is the next iteration of Vim.
Neovim adds Lua scripting and LSP support to Vim.
I like neovim because it's fast to start up and lightweight.
The neovim workflow makes it easy to develop very quickly and efficiently.
In neovim, it's easy to do complex operations without even needing to think about it.
This is because the modal and sentence-like editing are very compact and logical.
LSP support and completion make it a very good choice for most languages.
