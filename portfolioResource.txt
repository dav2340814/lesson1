One way I might use Github to create a portfolio is by contributing to open-source repositories.
I've heard that companies like to look at your Github profile to see how much you code.
In that regard, even if you don't have very many projects, companies will likely hire you if your commit history is blanketed with green.
Even though it can be good for your career to contribute to other projects, it's still good to make your own projects.
Starting your own projects can give you a better design sense, which can only be learned by designing and coding software from the ground up.

Github pages is also useful in creating a portfolio.
This is because it's easy to set up and free.
Having a website is a great way to show off your projects, and can also show potential employers that you can make websites.
Github pages can also lead potential employers to your Github profile, which can show them how much you (hopefully) code.
